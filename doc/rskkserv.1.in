rskkserv is yet another server program manages the dictionaries for SKK
(= Simple Kana-to-Kanji conversion program), one of the popular 
Kana-Kanji conversion programs for Japanese.
.PP
Compared with the other skkserv implementations, rskkserv has some
advantages; support for various formated dictionaries, easiness to extend
as written in ruby and so on.
.TP
.I [skk-dictionaries]
specifies the dictionaries to use. rskkserv doesn't only supports the
standard-style dictionaries, you can download from SKK Open Lab.:
http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk/, but also supports the EBdic dictionaries
(Note: you need libeb: http://www.sra.co.jp/people/m-kasahr/eb/ and
libeb-ruby: http://www.threeweb.ad.jp/~nyasu/software/ruby.html#rubyeb).
.I [CONFFILE]
specifies the system configuration file for rskkserv. The system
configuration file, indicates the path to the dictionaris to use,
is installed at /etc/rskkserv.conf and you only need this for the case
you don't use this system default configuration.
.PP
If the \fIskk-dictionaries\fR parameter is not given, the program trys to
determine them from the system configuration file(CONFFILE). 
.PP
When used with the \fB\-d\fR option the program runs on debug mode, so
that the detailed information to debugging will be printed out.
